The door refused to open. It said, "Five cents, please."
He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. "I'll pay you
tomorrow," he told the door. Again it remained locked tight.
"What I pay you," he informed it, "is in the nature of a
gratuity; I don't have to pay you."

"I think otherwise," the door said. "Look in the purchase
contract you signed when you bought this conapt."

...he found the contract. Sure enough; payment to his door for
opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip.

"You discover I'm right," the door said. It sounded smug.

â€œFrom the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless steel
knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the bolt
assembly of his apt's money-gulping door.

"I'll sue you," the door said as the first screw fell out.

# application versioning

http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/06/utorrent-bitcoin-miner/

"Popular torrent client can steal your CPU cycles to mine bitcoins"

"uTorrent's parent company BitTorrent has denied that the software is installed
without user consent, and told The Verge "we have reviewed the issue closely and
can confirm there is no silent install happening... most likely, the users
accepted the offer during the install."

# what if!

What if users could veto javascript releases from websites?

What if users controlled the machinery for their own content?

What if cryptographic signatures replaced user accounts?

# appcache manifesto

brick your website!

Once your website is loaded, it will always load. Forever.

Opt-in to updates.

# distributed offline authentication

Single sign-on is highly centralized.

User identities are a valuable commodity to online platforms.

---
# distributed authentication

distributed single sign-on:

asymmetric cryptography!

completely decentralized and works offline

---
# demo: keyboot

---
# DHTs

distributed hash tables, like bittorrent!

* ipfs
* webtorrent

---
# scaling

Inverse scaling of DHTs:

the MORE people download content,
the BETTER the network performs.

---

What kinds of applications can we build on top of a DHT?

# kd tree

KD tree: like a binary tree,
but compare against a different axis each level

```
X                 [15,7,50]
                 /         \
